    "A Neural Network, also known as a multi-layered perceptron, is a supervised learning algorithm that learns a function, which is trained using a set of features and targets. A neural network can learns a non-linear function approximator, allowing classification of data. Between the input and output layers, there are a set of non-linear hidden layers. The advantages of a neural network are it's ability to learn non-linear models and perform learning in real-time. However, a NN can suffer from different validation accuracy induced by random weight initialization, has a large number of hyper parameters which require tunning and is sensitive to feature scaling. \n",

    "As MLPs are sensitive to feature scaling, the data is scaled using the built-in StandardScaler for standardization. The same scaling s applied to the test set for meaningful results.\n",

    "Most of the MLPClassifier's parameters where left to random. However, several were modifed in order to enhance performance. Firstly, the solver was set to _adam_, which reffers to a stochastic gradient-based optimizer, the alpha regularization parameter was set to 1e-5, the number of hidden layers was set to 2, each with 70 neurons (numbers determined through experimentation throughout the day), and the max_iterations was set to 1500."
